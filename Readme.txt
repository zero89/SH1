Installation:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Put the folder the info.txt is in into your server's garrysmod/gamemodes directory.

2. Copy the server.cfg to your server's garrysmod/cfg directory.
	This will automatically set stronghold to it's optimal gameplay settings.
	
3. Download the official maps and put them in your server's garrysmod/maps directory.
	URL: http://stronghold.googlecode.com/files/sh_maps.zip
	
4. Learn how to set up fast download so people can get into your server quickly.

5. It's recomended that your max player limit is around 16 players, but you're probably
	going to be a faggot and make your server like 128 players or something so whatever.

Plea from the creators:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please don't totally fuck over our gamemode with shitty guns and roleplay bullshit.

The last thing we want to see in the server list is:
"RPcunts.fuck - Serious Stronghold Role-play | [MONEYPRINTERS][FURSUITS][DILDOGUNS][STUPIDBULLSHIT]".
"[FAGS] Stronghold fixed weapons with shitty muzzle heat wave effects and unmanagable unrealistic recoil bullshit"

We put a lot of work into making the game balanced. So, don't do any of that. Thank you.
